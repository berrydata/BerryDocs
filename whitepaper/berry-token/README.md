# Berry Governance Token \(BRY\)

BRY is Berry Data’s governance token. BRY is designed to empower the broader DeFi ecosystem to drive the creation of a fully transparent, community-owned, and open-source oracle platform on Binance Smart Chain.

## Token Distribution Model

The total BRY token circulation is 12,500,000. Token distribution is as follows:

60% - Mining: 40% will be provided through data mining; 20% will be provided through liquidity mining

24% - Ecosystem Fund: will be used for partners to build Berry Data project and its ecosystem as a vault

16% - IFO: will be sold on PancakeSwap IFO

Every time when BRY tokens are mined, smart contracts will generate 10% BRY tokens as team rewards to incentivize hard work and better commitment to the project.
