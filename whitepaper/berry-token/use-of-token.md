In order to propose changes on the platform or its governance stakeholders require a holding of 1,000 tokens. Voting rights can be delegated to a stakeholder.

📍 **Validate data through staking**

BRY tokens can be staked to incentivize the validation of existing oracles, scrapers, methodologies, and more.
