# How Berry Data Works

**Berry Data** is an oracle system where parties can request the value of an off-chain data point and miners compete to add this value to an on-chain data-bank, accessible by all dApps on Binance Smart Chain. The inputs to this data-bank are secured by a network of staked miners. **Berry** utilizes crypto-economic incentive mechanisms, rewarding honest data submissions by miners and punishing bad actors, through the issuance of BERRY’s governance token, **BRY**, and a dispute mechanism.

**Miners**: are incentivized to submit data using inflationary rewards, and which data types they update are chosen based upon the “tips” assigned to each query. 

**dApps/Data Users**: can be access to latest data feeds by paying BRY as the service fee. Apart from existing data feeds, they can request additional data/ price feeds by providing rewards as the incentive to miners.

**Data Feeds**: In every 2.5 minutes the BERRY smart contract groups the top five most funded data types and creates a PoW challenge for miners to solve. The first five miners to provide the PoW solution and the five off-chain data points are rewarded with newly minted tokens + the accumulated service fee for the specific data requests.  

**Deposit/ Rewarding System**: In addition to the security provided by the PoW process, our main layer of security comes through a deposit of BRY that acts as a deposit or stake requirement in order for miners to participate in the PoW. The miners risk losing this stake if they submit data that is successfully disputed by BRY holders.
