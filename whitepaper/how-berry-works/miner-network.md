# Network of Miners

Data submission is done through a competitive process where miners respond to PoW challenges and the winners get to submit data to Berry’s on-chain data feed. PoW provides an excellent source of sybil resistant randomness to Berry’s smart contracts as well as provides an ideal system for token distribution.

## Staking

Miners have to stake 1,000 BRY tokens to be able to mine. Staking allows for economic penalties to miners submitting incorrect values. If a miner wants to withdraw his stake, he can request a withdrawal at any time. The miner’s tokens are then being locked for 7 days in order to wait for potential disputes, at which point he can unlock his tokens for transfer.

## **Deposit & Rewarding System**

In addition to the security provided by the PoW process, Berry's main layer of security comes through a deposit of BRY that acts as a deposit or stake requirement in order for miners to participate in the PoW. The miners risk losing this stake if they submit data that is successfully disputed by BRY holders.
