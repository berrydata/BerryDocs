# Welcome

## Who is Berry?

Berry Data is a transparent community-veriﬁed price oracle on BSC\(Binance Smart Chain\). Berry Data provides a trustless and decentralized alternative for off-chain data. Also, it provides the infrastructure for decentralized applications to query off-chain data by properly incentivizing miners to provide data.  


## How does Berry work?

Berry Data is an oracle system that parties can request the value of an off-chain data point and miners compete to add this value to an on-chain data-bank, accessible by all DApps on Binance Smart Chain. The inputs to this data-bank are secured by a staked miners network. Berry Data utilizes crypto-economic incentive mechanisms, rewarding honest data submissions by miners and punishing bad actors, through the issuance of Berry Data’s governance token, BRY, and a dispute mechanism.

## Berry Governance Token \(BRY\)

BRY is Berry Data’s governance token. BRY is designed to empower the broader DeFi ecosystem to drive the creation of a fully transparent, community-owned, and open-source oracle platform on Binance Smart Chain.

The total BRY token circulation is 12,500,000. Token distribution is as follows:

55% - Mining: 40% of BRY will be mined out as block rewards to miners in the Berry oracle network; 15% of BRY will be provided through liquidity mining

23% - Ecosystem Fund: will be used for partners to build Berry Data project and its ecosystem as a vault. 7% will be used for the initial listing campaign and creating pools; 16% will be locked for 2 years and will be released every quarter

16% - IFO: will be sold on PancakeSwap IFO

6% - Team: will be locked for 2 years and will be released every quarter. Team vesting will start from the second quarter after the listin

## Berry’s Roadmap



Berry will dedicate to BSC ecosystem to improve its oracle product and expand partnership on BSC in the following few months. The detailed roadmap is as follows:

**2021Q1**

* **Berry Data Oracle** mainnet will be launched
* **Miner tools** will be released and miners can win BRY tokens rewards and services tips by providing data feeds in Berry oracle
* **Data feeds "plug-in" tools** will be released that dApps on Binance Smart Chain can easily access and require on-chain price feeds by easily engaging with Berry oracle
* Creating more **strategic partners**

**2021Q2**

* **The updated Berry Data smart chain** will take into consideration of reputation and track records of miners and source of data as important components for data selection. Those well-behaved miners and high qualified sources can get extra bonus.
* **Disputes Center** will be launched where every BRY token holder can monitor and dispute error data. Those who execute successful disputes will win huge rewards from the team.
* **More partners** will be on board to access on-chain data feeds through Berry Data

**2021Q3**

* ETH main-net will be launched
* Building a bigger and stronger Berry Data ecosystem and keep polish the oracle product.
