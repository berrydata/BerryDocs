# Welcome

## Who is Berry?

Berry Data is a transparent community-veriﬁed price oracle on BSC\(Binance Smart Chain\). Berry Data provides a trustless and decentralized alternative for off-chain data. Also, it provides the infrastructure for decentralized applications to query off-chain data by properly incentivizing miners to provide data.  


## How does Berry work?

Berry Data is an oracle system that parties can request the value of an off-chain data point and miners compete to add this value to an on-chain data-bank, accessible by all DApps on Binance Smart Chain. The inputs to this data-bank are secured by a staked miners network. Berry Data utilizes crypto-economic incentive mechanisms, rewarding honest data submissions by miners and punishing bad actors, through the issuance of Berry Data’s governance token, BRY, and a dispute mechanism.
