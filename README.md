# Welcome

## Who is Berry?

Berry Data is the transparent, community-verified price oracles on BSC. Berry provides a trustless and decentralized alternative for off-chain data. It provides the infrastructure for decentralized applications to query off-chain data by properly incentivizing miners to provide data.

## How does Berry work?

BERRY is an oracle system where parties can request the value of an off-chain data point and miners compete to add this value to an on-chain data-bank, accessible by all dApps on Binance Smart Chain. The inputs to this data-bank are secured by a network of staked miners. BERRY utilizes crypto-economic incentive mechanisms, rewarding honest data submissions by miners and punishing bad actors, through the issuance of BERRY’s governance token, BRY, and a dispute mechanism.
